(* [state] is the data in the game that has the ability to change
    in the game and must be updated.

    Effectively, this functions as the in game portion
    that follows the pre game set up portion

    We will update two things:
      player one's locations that he has targeted on
      player two
      and player two's locations that he has targeted on
      player one *)

(* state needs to store information for each player:
   Specifically, it would be nice if we could store:
    Where player stored his ships : so we can mark it damaged or not



   We need to know where player1 targeted, so that we can display his targets with
       either unknown (untargeted), hit (hit a ship of player2) or miss (miss a ship of player2)

   - data structures 
        We need to update dictionary of player 2, marking hits if player1 hits player 2
        We need an array of where player1 has targeted , marking with either unknown, hit or miss - to print to board

    Need to know the damage status of player1, so that we can display the status
      with either : No ship at location, hit (player 2 hit player1) or NotHit (player1's ship at coordinate safe)

   - data structures 
      We need to take the dictionary of player1, and have it display which coordinate of player1 ships were hit or safe
