# Battleship
## Final project for CS 3110

---

### State:
- records hits on ship and changes on the game state
- keeps tracks of which player's turn it is (player 1 or player 2 and determines what gets changed)

### Command:
- parses various commands
- fire, quit, place (x,y, orientation), remove, random, remaining (remaining players on own side and enemy side)

### Main:
- run actual game and read from terminal
- when first start off game, it will call "place_ship "player 1"" and will only change to "player 2" when the player one inventory is empty and when player inputs "finish"
- once "player 2" is finished putting down their ships, it will continue onto a method called "continue_game", where it will use the changing states for game functionality

### Battleship:
- everything constant
- ship locations
   - when inserting, check if Out of Bounds
