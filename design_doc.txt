There are four main modules to be used in this project,
Including:
Battleship module, which will hold the starting information
after the players set up the game, 

Data structures in battleship and their interpretation:
A dictionary of 
  key : ships
  value : list of coordinate and the status of the coordinate
 

State module: which contains information revelant to both 
players as the game progresses, as in
  Which player is to move
  Where that players ships are located
  Where that player has targeted
  Which ships the player has currently alive
  And which ships of the opponent that the player has sunk

  What we need currently in state:
  For the player1:
    We need to know where player1 targeted, so that we can display his targets with
       either unknown (untargeted), hit (hit a ship of player2) or miss (miss a ship of player2)

      - data structures 
        We need to update dictionary of player 2, marking hits if player1 hits player 2
        We need an array of where player1 has targeted , marking with either unknown, hit or miss - to print to board
