(**[command] represents what a player could type in during
   the laying down ships phase, as well as the targeting phase 

   Quit : represents a command to end the game. 
   InvalidCommand : a malformed command not part of the game. 
   Valid x y direction ship : a command to lay down a ship at coordinate
    (x, y) in direction [direction] with ship [ship].
    Does not guarantee that the ship can actually be laid down at 
    that location (x, y).

   Target (x, y) : represents a player targeting a location (x, y)
    on the enemy board. Does not guarantee that (x, y) can actually
    be targeted.

   YesNo b : represents affirmative if [b] is [true], [false] otherwise. 
   Remove s : represents removing a ship [s] from the board. Does not guarantee
    that the ship [s] can actually be removed. 

   FinishPlacement : represents a command to finish the laying down ships
    phase. Does not guarantee that the command will be carried out. 

   Random : represents a command to finish laying down the remainder of the
    ships for that player automatically, using computer randomly generated
    coordinates.

      by choosing a direction to target. 
    [Insane] is an algorithm by so and so... 
    [InvalidDifficulty] is an invalid command for a difficulty. *)
